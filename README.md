With the Right-Click WalkScore Chrome extension, you can get the WalkScore of any address just by selecting it, right-clicking (or ctrl-clicking), and choosing the <b>Get WalkScore for this address</b> context menu item provided.

The default configuration is to pop up a small summary window with just the walk, transit, and bike score badges of an address:

If you click on the summary popup, it will expand and load the detailed page in a larger window:

## Options

From the options dialog, you can configure the extension to deliver the score in one of three ways:

As illustrated above, the first option opens a small popup window with just the walk, transit, and bike score badges of an address. When clicked, this window expands to show the detail view in a larger window. This option is the default.

You may also configure the extension to open the full WalkScore results page in a new tab or a new window, skipping the summary popup window altogether.

(The background of the options dialog is the WalkScore map overlay for the city of Boston, MA.)

## Flexible input

Just like the input field in the WalkScore website itself, the input to the extension is somewhat flexible. It doesn't have to be a specific address.

You may, for example, get the WalkScore for a zip code, a city, or a neighborhood:

The popup now shows the walk, transit, and bike scores of the entire Belltown neighborhood of Seattle:

When you click on the popup, the expanded view is shown:
