With the Right-Click WalkScore Chrome extension, you can get the WalkScore of any address just by selecting it, right-clicking (or ctrl-clicking), and choosing the <b>Get WalkScore for this address</b> context menu item provided.

The default configuration is to pop up a small summary window with just the walk, transit, and bike score badges of an address:

If you click on the summary popup, it will expand and load the detailed page in a larger window:

## Options

From the options dialog, you can configure the extension to deliver the score in one of three ways:

As illustrated above, the first option opens a small popup window with just the walk, transit, and bike score badges of an address. When clicked, this window expands to show the detail view in a larger window.

You may also configure the extension to open the full WalkScore results page in a new tab or a new window, skipping the summary popup window altogether.

## Flexible input

The input to the extension is somewhat flexible. It doesn't have to be a specific address.

You may, for example, get the WalkScore for a zip code, a city, or a neighborhood:
